# TestCase-Generator

This project contains an HTML file that will allow us to create Test Case document with required data entered by user in a user-friendly way.

Some of the features include :
 - Adding a single Test Case
 - Adding multiple Test Cases
 - Clearing required data fields
 - Editing / Deleting a Test Case
 - Deleting all Test Cases
 - Export to Excel Functionality
 - Storing Test Cases (automatically) on LocalStorage of a browser


It is recommended to keep a back up of the Test Cases in an external file using Export to Excel functionality, if you intend to use different Browsers, since LocalStorage is browser specific.
